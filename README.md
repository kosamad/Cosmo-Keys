This is a typing game designed with visually impaired users in mind. Everything has been created to suit their needs  e.g colour choices, spoken elements and responsive functionality. However, it is also aimed to appeal to sighted users. It is a fun, interactive game with different levels of difficulty to accommodate different levels of skill.
